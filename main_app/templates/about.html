    Computer bugs are the heart and soul of every programming project development. Without bugs it would be much harder to learn programming, so what better way to show my appreciation of bugs than to dedicate an app towards it. This application is a really nifty way to log all of your bugs in hopes to make future debugging faster and easier. Also fun fact, the term bug came from an actual bug when a moth was found in a computer relay causing a malfunction.
